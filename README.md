## 🫧 Blob Simulation — Generative Canvas Experiment

A canvas-based generative art experiment that explores how simple mathematical signals can produce complex, organic visuals.

The current simulation deforms circular shapes by mapping **sine waves onto a circle’s circumference using polar coordinates**, resulting in smooth, animated, fluid-like blobs that evolve over time. The project is driven by curiosity and experimentation rather than any specific application or requirement.

### ✨ Current Features
- Procedural blob generation  
- Sine-wave–based radial deformation  
- Smooth time-based animation  
- Fully responsive canvas resizing  

### 🔮 Future / Experimental Ideas
- Mapping **Perlin / simplex noise** to the circumference for more organic, non-periodic motion  
- Hybrid deformation using **sine + noise** for controlled chaos  
- Randomized angular sampling for irregular geometry  
- Layered blobs for ambient backgrounds and visual fillers  
- Reuse as lightweight animated backgrounds for websites  

Built purely for fun, exploration, and learning — not optimization, frameworks, or interviews.<br>
